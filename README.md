ABSTRACT 
The purpose of computed tomography (CT) is to compute an accurate approximation of a scanned object from  a series  of  its  projections.  As  the  ground  truth  is  typically  unknown,  it  is  not  straightforward to determine  the  quality  of  such  an  approximation.  Even  if  the  reconstructed  image  corresponds  almost perfectly  with  the  observed  projection  data,  it  may still  be  quite  different  from  the  original  object if  the number of projections is small.  We have  recently  developed  a  series of mathematical error  bounds  that  provide  quantitative  guarantees on the quality of the reconstruction of a homogeneous object (i.e. a binary image). As these bounds are based on idealized assumptions of the imaging model (assuming perfect, noiseless data), they have to be adjusted to be useful in practice.  In this article we show how one of these error bounds can be adapted to be useful for bounding the quality 
of  experimental  images.  Our  experimental  results  suggest  that  even  though  approximations  have  to  be 
made  due  to  noise  and  other  errors  in  the  data,  the  resulting  bounds  can  still  provide  guidance  on 
estimating the reconstruction quality.
